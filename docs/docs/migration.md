# Migrating from Nango V0.2

Last update: 27th Jan 2023

The current version on the master branch is a rewrite of Nango to modernize it and improve development speed.

Whilst Nango is rapidly getting better it is not yet at feature parity with v0.2.2 yet (especially the proxy is missing, we are on it!).

If you are a current v0.2.x user please join us on the [Slack community](https://nango.dev/slack) where we share the latest updates in the #general channel.
