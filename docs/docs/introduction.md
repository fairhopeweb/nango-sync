# Get OAuth tokens for APIs. Fast & secure.

## ‚≠ê Nango at a glance

Nango is a service that contains everything you need to work with APIs that use OAuth.

It contains:
- a full OAuth dance for 40+ APIs
- a frontend SDK to trigger new OAuth flows
- a backend SDK & REST API to retrieve fresh access tokens for your API calls

Nango is easy to try in 5 minutes and can be deployed in 15:

- 1-liner to start a new OAuth flow in your frontend:
```ts
let result = await nango.auth('github', '<user-id>');
```

- 1-liner to retrieve a fresh access token (with our SDK or REST API):
```ts
let token = await nango.getToken('github', '<user-id>');
```

## üëæ Out of the box support for 40+ APIs

## üêª History

Pizzly was originally developed by the team at [Bearer](https://www.bearer.com/?ref=pizzly) with contributions of more than 40+ individuals. Over time the focus of Bearer shifted and they could no longer maintain Pizzly. In late 2022 the team at [Nango](https://www.nango.dev) adopted the project and has since maintained and evolved it together with the growing Nango community.
